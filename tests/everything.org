Some text before the initial heading.

* A Heading :tag1:

** A subheading :tag2:

*** TODO We have to go deeper :tag3:

*This is some bold text* within a normal paragraph. However I should tell you that
the paragraph doesn't end there. It has multiple lines! Oh, but having only one
would be lonely...

So we'll make /a second one/. How about some code?

#+begin_src haskell
  -- | Very complicated.
  main :: IO ()
  main = putStrLn "org-mode tests"
#+end_src

** More Interesting Blocks :tag2:

And a quote.

#+begin_quote
Always keep some cash on hand, you _never_ know.

- Albert Einstein
#+end_quote

#+begin_center
Behold _centered_ text (when exported, anyway).
#+end_center

#+begin_example
A fine example of _verbatim_ text.
#+end_example

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Here we expect indentation and whatnot to be preserved,

    while still accepting *markup*!

That's silly.
#+END_VERSE

#+begin_comment
This is totally ignored upon export.

Ironically, it _still_ supports *markup*.
#+end_comment

** Not a tag! :)

** TODO COMMENT A commented-out subtree

This whole subtree won't be exported.

*** Nor this, obviously.

** COMMENT

No actual heading text.

** TODO

None here either.

** DONE Gotta do it

* Another Heading!

[[https://www.fosskers.ca/][Check out my website.]] It has a blog with ~code~ samples.

This [[https://www.fosskers.ca][Link has /markup/ in it]] 

* Heading with /markup/

さぁ日本語も入れたらどうなる？

-----

Does*this*markup? No it doesn't.

* HTML Literals

Some @@html:<b>@@bold@@html:</b>@@ HTML.

#+HTML: <b>This entire line is bold!</b> But will be excluded from non-HTML exports.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
Exported <b>literally</b> to HTML.
#+END_EXPORT

* Drawers

This is some text.

* List with Parens

This is a paragraph (or is it?). There's only one way to know.
I think (*we should* be bold *about*) our decisions.

- Here is an item
- This (is an item too).
- This (is an item)
- This (*A* is)
- This (*A* is) a cat
- This (*A* yes *B*), why?

* List from About page

* List with numbers

1. Meditate.
2. ???
3. Reach Nirvana.

** Irritating List

1. First thing.
   - Sub point.
     1. But
     2. And
     3. Further
   - Another thing.
2. Second thing.
